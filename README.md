# Solutions for Lean 4 Natural Number Game

[Lean 4](https://leanprover.github.io/lean4/doc/)

[Game Server](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/hhu-adam/NNG4)

This repo proposes solutions for the game server, to help fellow learners.

The solutions by no means are the best, but they are the ones I came up with.

Better solutions are welcome, please open a PR.

Note `Multiplication World` is numbered as `#3` while `Implication World` is numbered as `#5`. This is only for the purpose of keeping the numbering sequential. In practice, these levels appear as parallel in the game server. Same is true for `Algorithm World` and `≤ World`.

## TODO

- `Power World` - done 9/10
- `Implication World`
- `Advanced Addition World`
- `Algorithm World`
- `≤ World`
